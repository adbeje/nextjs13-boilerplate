# Atomic Design and Storybook: Component Library Structure

The following documentation describes the structure of a component library using the Atomic Design patterns. Atomic Design is a methodology that suggests organizing components based on their level of abstraction, dividing them into five main categories: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

## Atoms

Atoms are the most basic and reusable components of the interface. They are the smallest building blocks and do not depend on other components to function correctly. Some examples of atoms can be:

- `Button`: An interactive button.
- `Input`: A text input field.
- `Icon`: A graphical icon.

The corresponding folder for atoms in the library structure could have the following organization:

```
src/
  components/
    atoms/
      Button/
        Button.tsx
        Button.css
        Button.stories.ts
      Input/
        Input.tsx
        Input.css
        Input.stories.ts
      Icon/
        Icon.tsx
        Icon.css
        Icon.stories.ts
```

## Molecules

Molecules are combinations of atoms that form more complex components with additional functionality. These components consist of one or more atoms and can have internal state. Some examples of molecules can be:

- `LoginForm`: A login form that combines text input fields (`Input`) and a button (`Button`).
- `Navbar`: A navigation bar that contains elements like a logo (`Icon`) and links (`Button`).

The folder structure for molecules could be similar to the following:

```
src/
  components/
    molecules/
      LoginForm/
        LoginForm.tsx
        LoginForm.css
        LoginForm.stories.ts
      Navbar/
        Navbar.tsx
        Navbar.css
        Navbar.stories.ts
```

## Organisms

Organisms are larger and more complex components that are formed by molecules and/or atoms. They represent more complete parts of the interface and may contain business logic. Some examples of organisms can be:

- `Header`: The header of a page that includes a navigation bar (`Navbar`) and other elements.
- `ProductCard`: A card that displays information about a product and uses components like images (`Image`), buttons (`Button`), and text.

The folder organization for organisms could be as follows:

```
src/
  components/
    organisms/
      Header/
        Header.tsx
        Header.css
        Header.stories.ts
      ProductCard/
        ProductCard.tsx
        ProductCard.css
        ProductCard.stories.ts
```

## Templates

Templates are components that define the overall structure of a page. These components can contain organisms and provide a reusable design structure. Some examples of templates can be:

- `DefaultTemplate`: A basic template with a header (`Header`), main content, and footer.
- `DashboardTemplate`: A template for a dashboard that includes a sidebar menu, main content, and possibly other components.

The folder structure for templates could be similar to the following:

```
src/
  components/
    templates/
      DefaultTemplate/
        DefaultTemplate.tsx
        DefaultTemplate.css
        DefaultTemplate.stories.ts
      DashboardTemplate/
        DashboardTemplate.tsx
        DashboardTemplate.css
        DashboardTemplate.stories.ts
```

## Pages

Pages represent the actual pages of the application or website and are built using the previously mentioned components. They combine templates, organisms, molecules, and atoms to create complete user interfaces for specific purposes.

```
src/
  pages/
    HomePage/
      HomePage.tsx
      HomePage.css
    AboutPage/
      AboutPage.tsx
      AboutPage.css
```

This structure follows the Atomic Design principles, allowing for a modular and scalable organization of components in your library.
